    <h1>A Day After the Sabbath</h1>
    <pre>
And it shall be;
on a day preceding the Sabbath.
On the Sabbath's ends, they will no longer see what they have not already seen.
Must it be a blessing of extra area and efficiency.
And the afterword;
the Sabbath does not mourn, nor will humans, nor will the land.
A day certainly will be eradicating.
