<h1>I have not much</h1>
  
  <pre>
    So, they live and continue.
    I am not one to judge or to stand in the way.
    To persevere is to be in fault of error; once.
    It speaks with a sanguine font; I have yet to find a thing to say.

    So long as the time moves; and she truly will.
    Its future shall find itself with one less than it had.
    The unprecedented emptiness by the windowsill.
    It does not incite for you to be sad.
    
    Nor will it evoke your anger.
    Truly, it is the best manager.
  </pre>

  <p>I would like to quote a few lines from La Vagulette;<br>
    <i>Moi, je suis serai tonjours là.<br>
    À voir le monde et sa beauté.<br>
    </i>
  <br>
   The translation in English would be:<br>
    <i>
      I am and always will be here.<br>
      To see the world and its beauty.<br>
    </i>
    <br>
    These verses have resonated with me. I thought I would still remain to see the future and its glory, but I do not know if this is what I desire. <br>
    If I leave this world, I would have not fulfilled my promise of still being here. But, this is what truly will occur and I have decided. It will not really matter, <br>
    I find it the best course of action to do so. I have not planned to remain and continue in my ways and now I have seen its light. <br>
    <br>
    To those who have been here, and to those who have tolerated me. <br>
    I cannot tell where the line is between these, in what I believe is that I'm not sure if people show me pity or if they actually like me for who I am. It <br>
    does not really matter, for it will make no change when I am not here. I thank those who have stood beside me and I will stay grateful.
